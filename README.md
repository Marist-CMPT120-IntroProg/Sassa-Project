# Project Goals
The main goals of this project are to create an interactive text adventure game in the style of Zork, in addition to reinforcing my Git and Python skills.

# Game Description
This game is based on my experiences biking along the Henry Hudson Bike Trail near where I live in Monmouth County, NJ. All of the locations listed in this game are real, as are some elements of the plot. 

The overall premise of the game is as follows: the player is a biker looking to make it home from Big Brook Park before nightfall by riding along the bike trail, or else they will encounter diving bats (this is based on a true story). In this game though, the bats are infected with a rare disease and have the ability to bite the biker, so it is imperative that the biker makes it home in time to avoid this scenario. 

Along the way, the biker will make stops at various locations along the bike trail and will complete tasks in order to continue with their journey. The locations and their associated tasks are as follows...


Locations:

Big Brook Park - starting point

The Coffee Shop - biker must make it to the coffee shop before closing time. biker must purchase an iced coffee to acquire the energy necessary to bike home.

Route 79 – biker must bike in the shoulder of the road while traveling from the coffee shop to the start of the bike trail. they must avoid getting hit by oncoming traffic.

The Bicycle Hub - the biker must make a pitstop at the local bike shop in order to refill their bike tires with air.

The Abandoned Airport – the biker will make a brief pitstop to watch the sun begin to set over the abandoned airport adjacent to the bike trail, and will be chased off of the tarmac by a hidden police car.

The Mausoleum – the biker will pass through a large cemetary and see a cult-like group of people wearing robes off in the distance. the biker must decide whether or not to go check out the group.

Dirt Bike Trails – the biker is now on a time crunch after all the previous stops and therefore must choose whether or not to save time by taking a cut-through on the dirt bike trails, all of which have challenging terrain.

Burnt Fly Bog Superfund Site - mud from a polluted bog has leeched onto a low-lying portion of the bike trail after a recent storm, causing the biker to have to decide between walking their bike (and taking up more time) or attempting to bike through it.

Freneau Electrical Substation - the biker will pass by a high-voltage substation 

Abandoned Shack - the biker will encounter a graffiti-covered shack near the end of the bike route and a man will emerge and beg for money. the biker must decide between engaging with the man or making a beeline for home.
