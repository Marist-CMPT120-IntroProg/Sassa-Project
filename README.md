# Project Goals
The main goals of this project are to create an interactive text adventure game in the style of Zork, in addition to reinforcing my Git and Python skills.

# Game Description
This game is based on my experiences biking along the Henry Hudson Bike Trail near where I live in Monmouth County, NJ. All of the locations listed in this game are real. 

The overall premise of the game is as follows: the player is a biker looking to make it home from Big Brook Park before nightfall by riding along the bike trail, or else they will encounter diving bats (this is based on a true story).

Along the way, the biker will make stops at various locations along the bike trail.
